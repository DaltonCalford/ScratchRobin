## Critical Path Analysis

### Must-Have for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

| # | Feature | Status | Risk |
|---|---------|--------|------|
| 1 | Connection Profile Editor | ✅ Complete | HIGH |
| 2 | Transaction Management Complete | ✅ Complete | MEDIUM |
| 3 | Error Handling Complete | ✅ Complete | MEDIUM |
| 4 | Capability Flags Complete | ✅ Complete | LOW |
| 3 | Table Designer Wired | 🔴 Not Started | HIGH |
| 4 | Error Handling Framework | 🔴 Not Started | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Users & Roles (Native) | 🔴 Not Started | LOW |

**Critical Path Blockers**:
- ScratchBird network listener availability (affects native backend testing)
- Missing specifications for Transaction Management, Error Handling

### Nice-to-Have for MVP

| Feature | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| ERD Canvas | 🔴 Not Started | High user value |
| Backup/Restore UI | 🔴 Not Started | Admin essential |
| Monitoring (Native) | 🔴 Not Started | Admin essential |

## Resource Allocation

### Estimated Effort by Category

| Category | Tasks | Effort | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| UI Implementation | ~60 | 10 weeks | P0 |
| Backend Wiring | ~40 | 6 weeks | P0 |
| ERD/Diagramming | ~52 | 8 weeks | P0 |
| Specifications | ~15 | 3 weeks | P0 |
| Testing | ~25 | Ongoing | P0 |
| Documentation | ~20 | 4 weeks | P1 |

### Team Size Estimates

| Team Size | Duration | Parallel Work |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 developer | 22-28 weeks | Sequential |
| 2 developers | 12-15 weeks | Foundation + ERD parallel |
| 3 developers | 8-11 weeks | Foundation + Managers + ERD |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| ScratchBird listener delays | Medium | High | Continue with mock backend |
| ERD complexity | Medium | High | Start with Crow's Foot only |
| wxWidgets limitations | Low | Medium | Use Cairo for custom rendering |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Strict P0/P1/P2 classification |
