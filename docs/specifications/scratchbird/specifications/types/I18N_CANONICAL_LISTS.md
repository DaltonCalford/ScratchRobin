# Canonical i18n Lists (Charsets + Collations)

**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** Alpha resource baselines and conformance reporting

## Purpose
Define the canonical charset and collation lists for Firebird, MySQL, and
PostgreSQL that ScratchBird must ship in `resources/`. These lists are the
source of truth for validation and for the conformance reports generated by
`scripts/report_i18n_conformance.py`.

## Canonical Source Definition

ScratchBird treats the resource JSON files as canonical for Alpha:

- `resources/charsets/charsets.json`  
  Each charset entry includes `supported_by`. This list defines the canonical
  charset set per engine.
- `resources/collations/collations.json`  
  Each collation entry includes `supported_by`. This list defines the canonical
  collation set per engine.

For upstream reference material:
- Firebird Appendix H (charsets + collations)
- MySQL 8.x charsets/collations (MySQL docs + XML sources)
- PostgreSQL encodings + collations (PostgreSQL docs + OS/ICU locale lists)

## Engine Canonical Lists

### Firebird
- Charsets: all entries where `supported_by` includes `Firebird`.
- Collations: all entries where `supported_by` includes `Firebird`.
- Source notes: Appendix H names must be preserved; aliases stored in
  `charsets.json`.

### MySQL
- Charsets: all entries where `supported_by` includes `MySQL` or `MariaDB`.
- Collations: all entries where `supported_by` includes `MySQL` or `MariaDB`.
- Source notes: default collations per charset are tracked in
  `resources/collations/tailorings/mysql/mysql_defaults.txt`.

### PostgreSQL
- Charsets: all entries where `supported_by` includes `PostgreSQL`.
- Collations: all entries where `supported_by` includes `PostgreSQL`.
- Source notes: locale-derived collations are captured via the locales snapshot
  under `resources/collations/locales/`.

## Conformance Reporting

Use `scripts/report_i18n_conformance.py` to generate a report that:
- Summarizes counts per engine.
- Flags missing mapping tables for non-Unicode encodings.
- Flags collations that reference missing charsets.

Example:

```
python scripts/report_i18n_conformance.py --output docs/findings/I18N_CONFORMANCE_REPORT.md
```
