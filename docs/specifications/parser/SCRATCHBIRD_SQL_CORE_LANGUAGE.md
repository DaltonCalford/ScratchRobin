# ScratchBird SQL Core Language (Alpha)

**Status:** Draft (Alpha)

## 1. Purpose

Define the core ScratchBird SQL language surface that is implemented in Alpha.
This document scopes the SQL baseline and points to the canonical grammar and
language references.

## 2. Canonical References

The following documents are the authoritative SQL core language sources:

- `ScratchBird/docs/specifications/parser/SCRATCHBIRD_SQL_COMPLETE_BNF.md`
- `ScratchBird/docs/specifications/parser/ScratchBird Master Grammar Specification v2.0.md`
- `ScratchBird/docs/specifications/parser/ScratchBird SQL Language Specification - Master Document.md`
- `ScratchBird/docs/specifications/parser/05_PSQL_PROCEDURAL_LANGUAGE.md`

## 3. Alpha Scope Notes

- Core SQL and PSQL are Alpha scope.
- Emulated dialect parsers map into SBLR and are documented separately.
- NoSQL extensions are defined in the Beta document:
  `ScratchBird/docs/specifications/parser/SCRATCHBIRD_UNIFIED_NOSQL_EXTENSIONS.md`.
