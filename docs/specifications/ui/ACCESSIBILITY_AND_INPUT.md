## Purpose

Defines accessibility and input requirements for ScratchRobin UI.

---

## Requirements

- Full keyboard navigation for all windows.
- Visible focus indicators on all controls.
- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text.
- Non-color indicators for state (icons + text).

---

## Input Rules

- All actions must be accessible via keyboard shortcuts.
- Mouse-only interactions must have keyboard equivalents.
- Avoid modal traps; allow escape key to close dialogs.

---

## Edge Cases

- If a feature cannot be keyboard-accessed, UI must provide fallback controls.
