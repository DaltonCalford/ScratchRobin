# SBSEC-06.02 Quorum Evidence and Audit Coupling


## 1. Purpose

Defines how quorum decisions are recorded, verified, and coupled to the audit log.

## 2. Evidence Record

A quorum evidence record MUST include:

- `proposal_id`
- `proposal_hash`
- `result` (APPROVED/DENIED/EXPIRED)
- `approvals` (list of approval records)
- `finalized_at`
- `finalized_by` (node id / principal)

Evidence MUST be persisted durably and MUST be retrievable for audit verification.

## 3. Verification Algorithm

To verify a quorum decision:
1. Recompute `proposal_hash` from canonical TLV (SBSEC-06.01).
2. For each approval:
   - verify signature against the approver’s public key,
   - ensure approval timestamp <= expires_at.
3. Apply the quorum rule for the operation type (SBSEC-06).
4. Ensure result matches recorded `result`.

## 4. Audit Coupling

When a quorum-gated operation executes, the engine MUST emit an audit event that includes:
- `proposal_id`
- `proposal_hash`
- `result`
- approver UUIDs (or a digest if redaction required)
- reference to evidence record location

At higher security levels, the audit event SHOULD include a signature over the event hash.
