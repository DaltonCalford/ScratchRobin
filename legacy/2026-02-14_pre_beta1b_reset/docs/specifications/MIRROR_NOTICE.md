# Mirror Notice

Many files under `docs/specifications/` are mirrored from the ScratchBird project to preserve
reference integrity for ScratchBirdSQL dialect and engine specifications.

- Source: `ScratchBird/docs/specifications/`
- Mirror policy: missing files are copied into ScratchRobin to resolve references; existing ScratchRobin
  specs are kept as authoritative for ScratchRobin-specific behavior.

For a breakdown of mirrored vs. ScratchRobin-authored specs, see:
- `docs/specifications/COPY_REPORT.md`
