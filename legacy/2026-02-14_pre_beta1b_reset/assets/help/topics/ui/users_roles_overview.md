# Users & Roles Overview

The Users & Roles window lists accounts, roles, and memberships for the
current connection. Use the tabs to switch between views and Refresh to
reload data.

Template actions (Create/Drop/Grant/Revoke) are displayed when a backend
supports them. In the current build, templates are read-only helpers.
