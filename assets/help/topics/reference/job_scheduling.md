# Job Scheduling

ScratchRobin includes a Job Scheduler window for ScratchBird connections.
It supports creating, editing, and running scheduled jobs along with viewing
run history and dependencies.

Use the Window menu to open Job Scheduler and refresh the job list. Jobs can
be created with CRON, AT, or EVERY schedules and executed immediately via
EXECUTE JOB.
