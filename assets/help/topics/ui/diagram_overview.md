# Diagram Window Overview

Diagram windows host ERD, data-flow, and UML canvases. Each diagram opens in
its own tab inside the diagram host window. The palette lists available
stencils, the canvas is the working area, and the properties panel shows
selected element details.

Diagram actions can be launched from the Connections menu or the Window menu.
